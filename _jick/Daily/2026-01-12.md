# WHTD

Good morning Jenn, Happy new year to you. I met with Om, Jeff and Vee once before I left for vacation and got an overview of Pulse data and clients submitting  requests via emails. There are 2 other team members I haven't met yet, Jermaine and Sami. Should I reach out to them? If there are existing documentation, I would love to see them. Also should I set up sometime for us to talk? Please let me know. Thank you.
