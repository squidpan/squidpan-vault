I am no longer billable at Gresham so I need to make sure this Pulse data position at Gresham works out. I should start apply outside of Gresham and continue to sharpen my skillset.

Today, I will continue with the udemy Spring boot training and continue to be able to build all the exercise code in IntelliJ IDEA.

System76 work: 
I will move my alias into ~/.bash_aliases
my environment variables into ~/.bashrc

Obsidian templates created so far that I need to make Bases out of:

[[Letter Template]]
