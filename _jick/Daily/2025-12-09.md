Hi Paul, 

Appreciate your patience.  I've discussed with Jeff and Dave and we would like to move forward with the BA work around the Pulse Data Business.  

Jeff is going to be in town next week in the NYC office so it would be great if you could get some in person time with him.  Ill also arrange some introductions to some other members of the team so you can start to meet with them to get some walk throughs and demos of the different systems and tools. 

Can you and Jeff work out schedules for next week to meet in person. 

  

Thanks, 
```
