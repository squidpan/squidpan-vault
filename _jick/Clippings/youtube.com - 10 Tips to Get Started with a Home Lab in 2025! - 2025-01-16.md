> 0:00 hey everyone welcome back to 0:01 virtualization how2 I'm Brandon Lee and 0:04 today I'm sharing 10 essential tips to 0:07 help you get started with a home lab in 0:10 2025 if you're diving into it for the 0:13 first time or experimenting with 0:15 self-hosting or maybe studying for 0:18 certifications these tips are some that 0:20 I wish I would have had when I first 0:22 started so let's dive in and talk all 0:25 things home lab in 2025 0:38 Number One Mini PCS forget big noisy 0:41 servers you simply just don't need them 0:44 today's modern mini PCS are powerful 0:47 they are efficient and they are compact 0:49 in size with up to 96 gigs of ddr5 0:52 memory multi-core processors 10 gig 0:55 networking they can handle workloads 0:57 very easily they're also much quieter 1:00 and easier on your electric bill 1:02 compared to Enterprise servers and trust 1:04 me once I made the switch to many PCs 1:07 which I was hesitant to do I've never 1:09 looked back especially in the hot summer 1:11 months here in the Southeastern part of 1:13 the United States I'm also really 1:15 encouraged by what 2025 can potentially 1:18 hold for mini PCS the mini forum msa2 is 1:22 just one example of an exciting Mini PC 1:25 that is set to drop in 2025 with 32 1:29 threads of processing power and 96 gigs 1:32 of memory and it takes all of the good 1:34 components of the mini Forum ms01 that 1:37 we've all loved such as the two SFP plus 1:40 10 gig ports and two 2 and 1/2 gig ports 1:44 that are all intel-based networking I'm 1:46 also really encouraged as I posted an 1:49 article just a couple of days ago that 1:51 crucial is actually going to release 64 1:54 GB sodm modules this is something we've 1:57 never had before poten potentially 2:00 giving us 128 gigs of memory in a Mini 2:05 PC form factor I'm really excited about 2:08 this year moving forward in this space 2:11 number two is RAM is most important 2:14 versus CPU so let's talk about resources 2:17 while CPUs are important Ram is actually 2:21 the real King in home lab environments 2:24 running multiple VMS or containers you 2:26 can quickly take up quite a bit of 2:28 memory and it it doesn't matter if 2:30 you're using VMware proxmox hyperv xcp 2:33 and or something else now if you are 2:36 running VMware esxi you can take 2:38 advantage of nvme memory tiering which I 2:42 did a video on if you want to check that 2:44 out it allows you to stretch your RAM 2:46 even further by using an additional nvme 2:49 m.2 Drive the moral of the story is if 2:52 you're on a budget budget for the 2:54 additional memory it's a much better 2:56 investment than chasing the fastest CPU 2:59 so I generally recommend to ones to dial 3:01 back the CPU configuration if that's an 3:04 option and take that cost savings and 3:07 buy another stick of ddr5 memory you're 3:10 not going to notice a bit milder CPU 3:13 when it comes to running virtual 3:14 machines and containers for most use 3:17 cases number three the network adapter 3:19 brand is very important make sure your 3:22 network adapter is compatible with the 3:24 platforms that you want to run many mini 3:27 PCS ship with real Tech network adapters 3:30 now while this isn't a big deal if 3:32 you're planning on running and 3:34 installing proxmox or XC PNG these don't 3:38 work out of the box with VMware esxi and 3:40 I know many are soured on VMware esxi 3:43 and probably moving to proxmox but if 3:45 you want the hardware that's cross 3:46 compatible look for those Hardware 3:49 adapters with Intel network adapters 3:51 they have that broad compatibility that 3:53 will allow you to work with VMware while 3:56 you can use a USB network adapter with 3:59 VMware config figurations I wouldn't 4:01 suggest that for long-term setups if if 4:03 it's anything outside of just playing 4:05 around installing hypervisors playing 4:07 for a couple of days and then tearing it 4:09 down I have found USB network adapters 4:11 to not be reliable over the long term 4:14 just really weird quirks and issues can 4:17 crop up so if it's your production home 4:20 lab environment that you're looking to 4:21 build hardware for I would certainly 4:23 suggest to stick with onboard network 4:25 adapters the number four tip is 4:28 networking in general for networking a 4:30 budget friendly switch with one or 2 and 4:33 1/2 gig Network ports and a couple of 10 4:36 gig ethernet ports is ideal microti and 4:39 similar Brands offer great options 4:41 however do keep in mind that with many 4:43 of these budget friendly switches you 4:46 typically don't get a manage switch 4:48 meaning you can't really log into the 4:50 switch interact with a CLI or a web 4:53 interface and do a whole lot of 4:55 configuration and often many of those 4:56 don't even allow you to create VLS now 4:59 VLS allow you to segment your network 5:01 into separate environments like servers 5:04 iot wireless LAN or something else they 5:08 are probably something that you're going 5:10 to want to implement sooner than later 5:13 so do keep that in mind if you're going 5:14 to invest the money in a switch I would 5:17 certainly suggest to get a budget 5:19 friendly switch but it actually is worth 5:22 it to get a switch that is VLAN capable 5:26 as you're not going to regret that in 5:28 your home lab moving forward number five 5:30 is Storage storage is often 5:32 underestimated in home Labs if you're 5:34 running multiple VMS or containers 5:36 you're going to need storage that is has 5:38 enough capacity that will allow you to 5:41 run the workloads that you want to run 5:43 but also that performs well options like 5:46 local drives Nas devices or software 5:49 defined storage like Seth is an 5:51 excellent option make sure though that 5:53 your setup can grow with your lab 5:55 whatever your intentions are plan for 5:58 and budget for for the additional 6:00 capacity you may need I recommend that 6:03 starting out you invest in cheap nvme 6:06 local storage for your virtual machines 6:08 if you're starting out with a Nas device 6:10 look at hybrid configurations for 6:12 storage that can give you a good mix of 6:14 speed and capacity for running VMS and 6:17 containers some of the newer nasas will 6:19 allow you to have both spindle hard 6:22 drives spinning rust discs as we like to 6:25 say and then also pair that with NVM 6:28 drives that can be used for caching on 6:31 write or read operations and when you're 6:33 talking about virtualization you can 6:35 really tell a huge difference with that 6:38 caching layer that allows those virtual 6:40 machines or containers to interact with 6:42 first number six is licensing 2024 into 6:46 this year is going to be a tricky one 6:48 especially if you do want to have access 6:50 to VMware licensing previously you could 6:52 pay $200 a year and get access to the 6:56 entire VMware catalog of products but 6:58 not so any more there is a new Cloud 7:02 Foundation certification requirement 7:05 before you can gain access to VMware 7:07 licensing even if you spring for the 7:10 vmug subscription now vmug subscription 7:14 will allow you to get a pretty sizable 7:16 discount off of that certification but 7:18 just know that the investment this go 7:21 around is not only going to be 7:22 monetarily but it's also going to be the 7:24 time and energy and effort that's going 7:26 to be required to study and and 7:30 potentially pass or fail these 7:32 certification exams so do keep that in 7:34 mind now if you're using other free and 7:37 open source options like so many are 7:39 these days such as crmx and xpg just to 7:43 name a couple then you don't have to 7:44 worry about licensing those are free and 7:46 open- Source options that are going to 7:48 provide a very powerful and robust 7:50 virtualization layer for your H lab 7:53 environment but do keep that in mind 7:55 when you're thinking about if you're 7:56 looking at VMware certifications or 7:59 running VMware inside your home lab 8:02 environment also when it comes to 8:03 licensing don't forget about really cool 8:05 tools that I think are worth the 8:08 investment in the home lab to up your 8:10 tooling game tools like painer which 8:14 also allows for a free three node 8:18 Business Edition license that you can 8:20 easily sign up for on their take three 8:24 uh link off of their website allows you 8:26 to have those three Business Edition 8:27 licenses also I think uh net data also 8:31 has a great option for monitoring a home 8:33 lab for 90 bucks a year you can buy that 8:37 home lab license with net data and you 8:39 can actually have that Enterprise class 8:42 monitoring for your home lab for 8:44 unlimited nodes there's no limitations 8:46 on it and that I think is really really 8:49 cool those are just a couple of options 8:51 that you have I think that are licenses 8:53 that are worth it to buy for the home 8:56 lab to have that affordable monitoring 8:58 as well as Docker Management in the case 9:01 of bainer number seven is backups you 9:04 never know when an experiment will go 9:06 sideways or you will experience a 9:09 hardware failure so have a backup 9:12 solution from day one tools like proxmox 9:15 backup server VH or even a simple Nas 9:18 device can save you hours of work if 9:21 something breaks and you have those 9:23 backups in place remember experimenting 9:26 is part of the fun but recovering from 9:29 mistakes is much easier with backups in 9:31 place but aren't backups only for 9:34 production environments not home lab 9:36 well technically the answer is probably 9:39 yes but when you have a handcrafted 9:41 configuration on a virtual machine that 9:42 may have taken you hours to build and to 9:45 get working correctly you don't really 9:48 know all the steps you took to build the 9:50 configuration would you want to lose 9:53 that potentially probably not many of 9:56 the backup Solutions like vhm and Niko 9:58 backup replication offer NFR licenses 10:02 that allow you to back up a number of 10:04 VMS in your home lab for free if you 10:07 have something like a sonaly nass device 10:09 you get access for free to the active 10:12 backup solution that allows backing up 10:15 VMware and hyperv if you want to get 10:18 into running Docker containers you can 10:20 also use tools like duplicati for Docker 10:24 container data and then also if you're 10:26 getting into kubernetes you can download 10:28 a solution from VH that is totally free 10:31 called Casten K10 for kubernetes backups 10:35 number eight is a UPS protect your lab 10:38 hardware and network Hardware with a UPS 10:42 sudden power outages can corrupt setups 10:44 data or even damage Hardware a UPS not 10:48 only provides backup power if you have a 10:51 power flicker or you have an allout 10:53 power outage but it gives you time to 10:55 shut things down gracefully and properly 10:58 some even have Network monitoring 10:59 features which is a nice bonus for lab 11:02 enthusiasts that can even orchestrate 11:04 shutdowns during a power outage event If 11:07 you experience those so a UPS is a wise 11:10 investment I think in a home lab even a 11:13 small 1500 voltamp UPS will actually run 11:18 quite a few mini PCS and keep those up 11:20 at least for a couple of minutes number 11:22 nine is start with open source and free 11:25 tools we've already touched on this but 11:27 if you're just starting out stick to 11:29 those open source tools just to get your 11:31 feet with things like proxmox xcp and 11:34 using free tools like Docker and 11:36 kubernetes these are powerful and 11:39 ready-made options that have no 11:41 licensing fees especially in the home 11:43 lab and they allow you to learn these 11:45 advanced concepts without spending any 11:47 money on licensing or the software to 11:50 get started again many are using proxmox 11:53 or XC PNG for home labs and are using 11:55 Docker and kubernetes for running 11:57 application containers also there are 12:00 many free and open- Source projects out 12:03 there that you can take advantage of 12:05 like my last video my Docker dashboard 12:08 project check that out be sure to 12:10 download the docker dashboard once you 12:12 have a home lab up and running and you 12:15 can see all of your Docker containers in 12:17 a single glance across all of your 12:19 Docker hosts number 10 is 12:22 documentation documentation is that step 12:25 that we all hate but it's my final tip 12:28 document everything you'll be surprised 12:31 if you document everything as you're 12:33 installing as you're connecting 12:35 everything tracking your configurations 12:37 IP addresses VLAN setups and even 12:40 troubleshooting that you may have to do 12:42 make sure you document those tools like 12:45 notion obsidian and even a simple 12:48 spreadsheet work great and then also 12:50 along with learning Docker there are 12:52 many dockerized open source Solutions 12:54 out there like PHP ipam that make it 12:56 much easier to keep up with your network 12:58 configuration ation like IP addresses 13:01 and vlans and all of those Network 13:04 configurations that we all know and love 13:06 good documentation will save you time a 13:08 lot of frustration as your lab grows and 13:11 you just 6 months later forget how 13:13 something was configured and your 13:15 scratching your head you'll have the 13:16 ability to pull out your documentation 13:18 and immediately get the answer to those 13:20 configuration questions and that's it 10 13:22 tips to get started with a home lab in 13:24 2025 from choosing the right Hardware to 13:28 protecting your setup with with backups 13:29 and power management I hope these tips 13:31 will help you to hit the ground running 13:34 if you have questions or your own tips 13:35 to share let me know in the comments 13:37 below if you enjoyed this video
