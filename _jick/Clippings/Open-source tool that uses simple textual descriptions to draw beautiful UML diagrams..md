## 🌱 PlantUML at a Glance

## 🚀 Getting Started

**PlantUML** is a highly versatile tool that facilitates the rapid and straightforward creation of a wide array of diagrams. Utilizing a simple and intuitive language, users can effortlessly draft various types of diagrams. For a detailed exploration of the language's capabilities and syntax, please refer to the [PlantUML Language Reference Guide](https://plantuml.com/guide).If you are new to PlantUML, we recommend starting with our [quick start page](https://plantuml.com/starting) to get up and running quickly. Should you have any questions, our [F.A.Q. page](https://plantuml.com/faq) is a valuable resource. Additionally, PlantUML can be seamlessly integrated with [a variety of other tools](https://plantuml.com/running) to enhance your workflow.

## 🧩 Supported UML Diagrams

With PlantUML, you can create well-structured UML diagrams, including but not limited to:

- [Information Engineering (IE) diagram](https://plantuml.com/ie-diagram)
- [Entity Relationship (ER) diagram](https://plantuml.com/er-diagram)

## 📣 Additional Features

Enhance the dynamism and informativeness of your diagrams with these additional features:
- [Hyperlinks and tooltips](https://plantuml.com/link) to provide extra context and interactivity
- [Rich text formatting, emoticons, Unicode, and icons with Creole](https://plantuml.com/creole) for a visually appealing presentation
- [OpenIconic icons](https://plantuml.com/openiconic) for enhanced visual representation
- [Sprite icons](https://plantuml.com/sprite) to add custom symbols
- [AsciiMath mathematical expressions](https://plantuml.com/ascii-math) for precise mathematical representation

## 📥 Input Formats

PlantUML allows you to generate diagrams from various source input formats:
- [Source input data: *How and where diagrams can be written*](https://plantuml.com/sources)
You can choose from different internal encodings:
- [PlantUML Text Encoding](https://plantuml.com/text-encoding)

## ⚙ Layout Engines and Options

PlantUML allows you to use several different [layout engines](https://plantuml.com/layout-engines):
- [Graphviz](https://plantuml.com/graphviz-dot) is the default engine. Relies on an external program;
- [Smetana](https://plantuml.com/smetana02). *(Use `!pragma layout smetana` in the file or `-Playout=smetana` on the command-line.)* A port of Graphviz to Java. Tends to make slightly straighter arrows;
- [VizJs](https://plantuml.com/vizjs) uses JavaScript. *(Use `-graphvizdot vizjs` on the command line.)* Tends to space out nodes more, resulting in a bigger diagram;
- [ELK (Eclipse Layout Kernel)](https://plantuml.com/elk). *(Use `!pragma layout elk` in the file or `-Playout=elk` on the command-line.)* Supports only orthogonal layout, and doesn't cover all features.
[Sequence diagrams](https://plantuml.com/sequence-diagram) have 2 engines:
- *Puma* is the older and still default engine;
- [Teoz](https://plantuml.com/teoz) *(Use `!pragma teoz true` in the file or `-Pteoz=true` on the command-line)* is a new engine that has some unique features: *anchors (named arrows/messages), duration, nested boxes...*

> Achieving good layout with PlantUML is sometimes non-trivial. *See [PlantUML GraphViz Layout](https://isgb.otago.ac.nz/infosci/mark.george/Wiki/wiki/PlantUML%20GraphViz%20Layout) by Mark George at University of Otago for more advice.*

## 📤 Output Formats

Export your diagrams in a variety of formats to suit your needs, including:
- PNG for easy image sharing
- [SVG](https://plantuml.com/svg) for scalable vector graphics
- [LaTeX](https://plantuml.com/latex) for high-quality typesetting
- [EPS (Encapsulated PostScript )](https://plantuml.com/eps) for used with LaTeX
- [ASCII art](https://plantuml.com/ascii-art) *(available only for sequence diagrams)* for a text-based representation
