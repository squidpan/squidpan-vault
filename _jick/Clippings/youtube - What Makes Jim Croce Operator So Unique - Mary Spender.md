> 0:00 hey everybody I'm Rick biato 0:03 and I'm very expensive sorry 0:06 there we go now take already 0:09 I didn't really 0:10 exit to um start filming what do you 0:12 mean well yeah hi Mary you're a YouTuber 0:16 where I can use it as an outtake this 0:18 will be the beginning video so Mary's 0:20 here visiting everybody that you all 0:22 know Mary spender she's here here 0:23 visiting last time we were in that Mary 0:25 was in town was in January we made a 0:27 video on the greatest uh two Chord song 0:31 of all time actually we did three songs 0:33 even though I said it's the greatest two 0:34 Chord song of all time so we're talking 0:36 about okay what are we gonna make for a 0:38 video and I brought up this Jim Croce 0:41 song operator and Mary is uh how old are 0:44 you Mary 32. okay so Mary's 32 0:48 um but we were talking about lyrics and 0:50 we I never really talk about lyrics on 0:52 here but since I'm with a great 0:54 songwriter here that will we want to 0:56 talk about the lyrics of Mary and I love 0:57 this song this is a classic one of the 1:00 best songs ever written and somebody 1:01 emailed me yesterday about it and said 1:03 Rick why haven't you made a video on the 1:05 song Operator by Jim Croce and I thought 1:07 okay we'll make a song on the operator 1:08 but I always think about this because 1:10 the lyrics 1:12 don't really make sense to people today 1:16 young people because there's things like 1:19 a dime this is a dime here's my little 1:22 prop here and so you can see a dime 1:24 actually you can't see the diamonds it's 1:25 so small it's so small it's a dime this 1:27 is what you used to need to make a phone 1:28 call in here so Mary called her 1:32 dad her parents to see how much it used 1:35 to cost to make a phone call and they 1:37 said Sixpence Sixpence supposedly got 1:39 you two minutes yeah so dime was about 1:42 about was about two minutes or so the 1:44 idea of a phone booth is is a really odd 1:47 thing too you know when I was growing up 1:48 phone boosts were everywhere right and 1:50 then obviously in England you had your 1:52 red phone booths are kind of famous we 1:55 still have them but they've been turned 1:56 into little bookshops where you like 2:00 literally you take a book out and then 2:02 you have to replace the book like that's 2:03 the 2:04 the free-for-all thing so so here's so 2:08 this song operator I'm going to play it 2:09 here this Jim Croce song but but it 2:11 deals with things like operators but 2:14 there's some really interesting lyrical 2:16 things that Mary was just talking about 2:18 but let's play the beginning of the song 2:20 \[Music\] 2:36 operator or could you help me please 2:41 \[Music\] 2:47 \[Music\] 2:50 okay 2:51 we have matchbooks we have an operator 2:54 okay so what is an operator an operator 2:57 is somebody that used to 2:58 talk to if you needed to make a collect 3:02 call or something right 3:04 possibly not in my era yeah but we did 3:07 have phone booths and then you would pay 3:10 before mobile phones because I didn't 3:11 get a mobile until I was about a cell 3:13 phone sorry until I was about 15. so but 3:16 this was before that obviously most 3:19 people watching will know will remember 3:22 maybe or you needed if you needed a 3:25 phone number you could call the operator 3:26 and they give you a phone number you 3:28 give them a name and they would look it 3:29 up right so you have we have operator 3:32 can you help me place this call see the 3:34 number on the matchbook is old and Faded 3:36 so matchbooks 3:37 I want to give my number to someone on a 3:39 matchbook I'm going to do that when's 3:40 the last time you saw a matchbook I 3:42 don't know no one smokes anymore 3:45 so matchbooks you commonly you would 3:48 write things on matchbooks if you were 3:50 in a in a bar or someplace and and but 3:52 this is really 3:54 idiomatic to the 70s right this is a 3:57 already a very 70s lyric It's A 3:59 Beautiful lyric though 4:01 but let's continue to listen 4:06 \[Music\] 4:15 okay talk about that lyric how great 4:18 that is the heartbreaking that 4:19 immediately living in LA with my best 4:23 old ex-friendly 4:25 and how her opinion of him when they 4:27 were together was 4:29 you know she was keeping her distance 4:31 but obviously there was some attraction 4:33 there that then LED them to go off 4:36 but Mary pointed out that this is really 4:38 already it even starts out the beginning 4:40 as a one-sided conversation right yeah 4:43 the operator doesn't really talk and 4:45 this and we were thinking about the 4:47 equivalent now 4:48 instead of an operator we were thinking 4:50 of joking about like would you be 4:52 calling Siri 4:53 can you help me well Siri helps you 4:57 place the code you don't even need Siri 4:58 you don't even need any of that would 5:00 you be just like no I actually I do if 5:01 I'm driving in the car I'll say Siri 5:03 call Mary spender and it will dial Mary 5:06 is your phone about to start dialing me 5:09 actually it's not that's funny because I 5:12 call you on WhatsApp yeah 5:15 and it won't actually work okay but this 5:17 is she's living in LA with my best old 5:20 ex-friend Ray is such a great lyric it's 5:24 so concise and the story that it moves 5:27 through you know that you immediately 5:29 know there's history and pain and then a 5:31 guy she knew well and sometimes hated 5:33 yeah oh my God that is 5:36 it's such a complex idea and yet I feel 5:39 like it's very Universal I'm sure most 5:42 people if you've had your heart broken 5:43 that person has gone off with someone 5:46 maybe you once knew or introduced them 5:48 to just as your friend is it a guy she 5:51 knew well and sometimes hated no his 5:54 best old ex-friend his best old 5:55 experience he knew 5:58 and she would have been like that guy 6:00 he's a you know a so-and-so and yeah so 6:03 that's her talking to him about him 6:05 about Rey yeah and then she ran off with 6:08 Ray 6:09 but that's in the first verse right 6:12 there's so much information in this 6:15 verse it's unbelievable and it's a 6:16 one-sided family not to mention the fact 6:18 that this song is so weird to play 6:21 because there are so many chords we're 6:24 gonna try and play it but yeah I started 6:27 giving up the guitar part and then even 6:29 Even Rick was struggling I'm not even to 6:32 the hard part yeah Okay let's listen on 6:34 \[Music\] 6:35 foreign 6:43 \[Music\] 6:57 \[Music\] 7:06 \[Music\] 7:12 so I can call just to tell him I'm fine 7:14 and to show I've overcome the blow I've 7:16 learned to take it well I only wish my 7:18 words could just convince myself oh my 7:20 God that is the the insecurity when 7:23 you're like I just need to tell that 7:24 person I'm doing great 7:27 everyone's done that and yet you're so 7:29 not over it but it's still thinking 7:31 about calling me it's so poetic though 7:33 the way he says that 7:34 it's also very um he's there's no anger 7:37 in in any of it no and it's not sad 7:41 either yet and then there's a lyric 7:44 later where I go oh you can finally feel 7:46 the sadness it's quite like it's like um 7:49 you know I'm I'm fine I'm doing great 7:50 I'm I'm cool I'm cool I'm doing I'm 7:52 doing fine okay so how does the chorus 7:54 start there isn't that the way they say 7:58 it goes well let's forget all that 8:02 me the number if you can find it so I 8:07 can call just to tell him I'm fine to 8:10 show 8:15 I only wish my words could just convince 8:18 myself that it just wasn't real 8:22 that's not the way it feels 8:26 \[Music\] 8:32 so hey that is uh I got like in that 8:36 only one only one little mistake so Bob 8:39 isn't that the way they say it goes well 8:42 let's forget all let's forget all that 8:44 yeah and give me the number if you can 8:46 find it so I control just cool just to 8:49 tell him I'm fine and to show I'm fine 8:55 the things he doesn't protest too much 8:59 so 9:01 \[Music\] 9:06 okay so we would be remiss if we didn't 9:10 talk about the guitar work of Maury 9:13 mulinson 9:15 about how unbelievably great it is I 9:19 mean that's really the other thing that 9:21 makes this song be Beyond Jim's 9:24 incredible lyric writing Melody is the 9:27 guitar fills are unbelievably great and 9:30 they make it just even more interesting 9:32 that it is it would be hard to cover 9:34 without a second guitarist doing right 9:37 it sounds weird when I when I just am 9:40 playing yeah foreign 9:42 the chords without that second guitar 9:45 part it really doesn't it doesn't even 9:48 work that way let's go to the next verse 9:50 here 10:01 okay let's unpack that line that is 10:05 that's so sad because I can't read the 10:08 number that you just gave me there's 10:10 something in my eyes 10:12 tears 10:14 \[Music\] 10:22 \[Music\] 10:26 that would save me 10:30 I mean it is so it gives me goosebumps 10:32 yeah 10:33 it gives me goosebumps because I can't 10:35 read the number that you just gave me 10:37 and I also think for a man in the 70s to 10:39 be talking about having tears in his 10:41 eyes thinking about his ex best friend 10:43 Rey and his girl now just to put in 10:46 perspective Jim Croce's career took off 10:48 in 1972 with this record you don't mess 10:52 around with Jim and he Ed Mori passed 10:56 away in the same plane crash September 10:59 20th 1973 a year later 11:02 and 11:04 it's he has so many amazing songs the 11:09 guy had a greatest hits record that I 11:12 grew up with everyone I knew had Jim 11:14 Croce's Greatest Hits because he had so 11:16 many phenomenal songs in this short 11:20 period of time these couple records that 11:22 he did are just 11:23 really is such a shame yeah such a shame 11:26 but this uh very vulnerable lyric there 11:31 I mean yeah it's just incredible that 11:34 just the imagery in the lyrics 11:38 and this guy he's just there but he's 11:40 not emotive yet like 11:42 um he's singing it very matter-of-factly 11:44 you just gave me you know and it's going 11:47 up and everything it's not like hmm it's 11:50 not miserable what's funny because the 11:51 song yeah it's in a major key or it's in 11:53 G where is here two three four 11:58 she goes 12:03 \[Music\] 12:09 \[Music\] 12:10 sure 12:15 \[Music\] 12:18 just convince myself that it just wasn't 12:21 real 12:23 that's not the way it feels so it's a 12:26 really upbeat chorus even though the 12:28 lyrics are really depressing but that's 12:31 the best way I remember hearing Sara 12:34 Bareilles talk about it where she was 12:35 like you can get away with so much if 12:37 you keep the the music upbeat and you 12:40 can have the most devastating lyrics in 12:42 a song and people will be singing it 12:44 along being all like happy and then when 12:46 they listen to it they're like oh my God 12:48 this is like this is something else well 12:50 the way that it does is it um 12:53 \[Applause\] 12:54 \[Music\] 12:57 there's so many core changes there but 12:59 they make it sound so effortless when 13:01 they're playing it I know but it's it's 13:03 it's moving 13:06 incredibly fun really fast harmonic 13:08 Rhythm meaning the chords change very 13:10 quickly which you just don't hear as 13:12 much anymore but it's so smooth that you 13:14 don't even notice that they're changing 13:16 that fast it sounds effortless yeah 13:17 except when I'm when I'm hacking when 13:20 I'm hacking along well I was doing away 13:22 once 13:23 \[Music\] 13:26 also I'm singing in the original key so 13:28 it's not so jarring when we when we play 13:30 it but obviously this is sung by a man 13:32 so I'm very nice and low 13:35 \[Music\] 13:37 isn't isn't left away 13:39 they say it goes 13:45 if you can't find it so I can call just 13:50 to find to show 13:53 I've overcome 13:55 \[Music\] 14:00 and it just wasn't real 14:05 but the way it feels 14:07 \[Music\] 14:09 that's a rich just G to see twice 14:15 now what were you saying about the 14:17 bridge Mary I feel like because he's 14:19 leaving less gaps between he's creating 14:21 these changes that are really subtle and 14:23 if you're just listening to it you're 14:24 like oh then okay he's just moving 14:26 through but then he he's just leaving 14:28 less space which I then think leads to 14:31 something else being a little bit more 14:33 significant at the end of this verse 14:36 \[Music\] 14:41 don't worry about 14:43 we don't forget about this car 14:47 okay so this is one time that actually 14:50 changes the base is going 14:53 instead of just hanging on a minor they 14:56 do that moving line which is really 14:58 interesting 15:00 right here 15:05 \[Music\] 15:12 \[Music\] 15:15 thank you for your time 15:18 you've been so 15:20 more kind 15:21 \[Music\] 15:23 to keep it dying 15:26 that space is significant that is you 15:29 can keep the dime once again the 15:31 one-sided conversation though the 15:34 operator says nothing do they 15:37 well yeah they say 15:39 you I mean 15:42 so emotive in there um oh you've been so 15:44 much more than kindly he's been so 15:45 polite yeah it's very English 15:49 but I think the the change after all the 15:52 lyrics before that um you know I think 15:54 about a love that I thought would save 15:56 me 15:57 um guys she she said she knew well and 15:59 sometimes hated like it's and then 16:01 just to then have half the line you can 16:04 keep the dime right because as a 16:06 listener you're like oh there should be 16:08 something else there but it's the 16:09 storyline is just progressing it's just 16:11 beautiful which again is just one of 16:13 those little songwriting tricks just to 16:15 move you 16:18 because you're missing something as The 16:19 Listener because you've been used to it 16:21 before and then he doesn't do it again 16:24 foreign 16:38 \[Music\] 16:48 \[Music\] 16:59 \[Music\] 17:07 foreign 17:08 \[Music\] 17:15 it's an extraordinary song so sad that 17:18 his career was cut short I mean what a 17:21 talented songwriter some of his other 17:23 songs uh time in a bottle I got a name I 17:27 have to say I love you in a song so many 17:28 phenomenal Jim Croce songs his his 17:31 grades I mean I did a couple records and 17:33 had a greatest hits record that 17:34 everybody owned when I was growing up 17:36 that says it all there and I can only 17:38 imagine what his career would have been 17:40 had he lived Mary 17:42 thanks so much for having me always 17:43 great to have you 17:44 I love how we were just actually making 17:46 this video without filming and we were 17:48 just geeking out about this song so uh 17:51 follow Mary on her Channel if you don't 17:52 already subscribe to it but um
