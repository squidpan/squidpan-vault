> 0:00 hey everyone welcome back to 0:01 virtualization howto and today we're 0:03 diving into a topic that is no doubt on 0:06 your list of things to try in the home 0:07 lab kubernetes specifically we're going 0:10 to explore the best kubernetes dros for 0:13 your home lab in 2024 if you're looking 0:15 to set up kubernetes at home stick 0:17 around because I've got some great 0:18 options to share with you so let's get 0:21 started 0:25 \[Music\] 0:32 first of all why use kubernetes isn't it 0:34 complicated and a headache to manage yes 0:38 it can be but it is arguably the coolest 0:41 way to run containers in a way that has 0:44 ha or high availability and ha just 0:47 simply means your containers are 0:48 protected from a host or other Hardware 0:51 failures I like to think of kubernetes 0:53 for running your containers like a 0:55 hypervisor cluster that we've 0:57 traditionally Run for the past few 0:59 decades now running virtual machines 1:02 with shared storage and other components 1:04 if you have a host that fails another 1:07 host just simply spins up those virtual 1:09 machines well the same is true in 1:10 kubernetes if you have a kubernetes host 1:13 that fails a another host or a healthy 1:16 host just simply spins up those pods as 1:19 they are called in kubernetes and you're 1:22 often running like nothing ever happen 1:24 setting up kubernetes in a home lab can 1:26 also be a fantastic way to gain hands-on 1:29 experience with container orchestration 1:31 but with so many distributions available 1:33 it can also be a bit overwhelming to 1:36 choose the right one based on a recent 1:38 blog post that I posted on the new blog 1:40 that I have spun up called Tech to Cloud 1:42 I've narrowed it down to the top 1:44 contenders for 20124 that I feel are an 1:47 easy way to deploy and install 1:50 kubernetes in just a few minutes and 1:52 you'll be up and running with your first 1:54 Cube CTL command in just a few minutes 1:57 so let's break that list down first up 1:59 we have micro Kates if there's one 2:01 solution that you can get up and running 2:03 quickly and easily it's micro Kates this 2:06 is a lightweight kubernetes distribution 2:09 from canonical the same company that 2:11 makes auntu and it's designed to run on 2:13 resource constrained devices while it's 2:15 a great fit for Edge clusters you can 2:17 also use it as a lightweight home lab 2:20 kubernetes without much hassle now why 2:22 micro Kates first of all it's easy to 2:25 set up with a simple snap command it has 2:28 low resource usage and it also supports 2:31 add-ons for extended functionality and 2:34 you can also run it inside of a Windows 2:37 subsystem for Linux or WSL instance 2:40 making it even easier if you're running 2:42 a Windows workstation to get your hands 2:45 on microc Cates now let's see how to 2:47 install micro Kates so we have a Windows 2:50 subsystem for Linux terminal open and we 2:53 are going to run this simple oneline 2:55 command to get micro Kates installed for 2:58 our home lab environment and that 3:00 command is sudu snap install micro Kates 3:04 and we need to pass the classic 3:12 flag now that we've installed micro 3:14 Kates we can check the status of the 3:16 cluster by issuing the command sudu 3:18 microad 3:21 status and we can scroll back up just a 3:23 little bit we can see micro Kates is 3:25 running High availability is set to no 3:28 which makes sense because we at this 3:30 point are just in a single node 3:32 configuration just having installed 3:34 micro Kates in our windows subsystem for 3:37 Linux environment however the cool thing 3:39 is you can now go to sudu micro Kates 3:43 Cube 3:44 CTL get nodes and we see that we've got 3:48 our single node cluster up and running 3:51 we can issue other commands such as sudu 3:53 my Cades tube CTO get all and then- a 3:58 for all Nam spaces and we can see all of 4:00 our Cube system resources that are 4:03 available so super cool as you guys can 4:05 see in just a couple of minutes we have 4:09 a very powerful insulation of kubernetes 4:12 and micro Kates and if you notice if we 4:14 go back to Pudu micro katees status 4:18 there are a tremendous amount of add-ons 4:21 that you can add on to your micro Kates 4:24 cluster assert manager Community 4:27 dashboard GPU add-on including Rook 4:30 storage for micro Kate so a powerful 4:33 kubernetes distribution that you can 4:35 easily start playing around with 4:37 kubernetes clustering in your home lab 4:39 next let's talk about the next 4:41 kubernetes variant on our list and that 4:43 is mini Cube mini cube is a popular 4:46 choice for setting up a single node 4:49 kubernetes cluster and it supports many 4:51 different virtualization Technologies so 4:53 if you're running KVM if you're running 4:55 hyperv if you're running Docker and also 4:58 again you can run it inside of Windows 5:00 subsystem for Linux or WSL so it 5:03 provides a lot of great options on the 5:05 virtualization side for whatever 5:07 environment that you already have up and 5:10 running in your home lab now why mini 5:12 coup well it's easy to set up and use 5:15 like micro Kates I would say it's a bit 5:17 more complex than micro Kates to get 5:20 configured and up and running however 5:21 it's excellent for Learning and 5:23 Development environments and it supports 5:25 those multiple virtualization drivers 5:27 that you can run mini Cube on top of so 5:30 let's see how we can get up and running 5:32 with mini cube in our home lab now let's 5:35 install mini Cube the installation of 5:37 mini Cube requires a few more commands 5:40 but we're going to explain what these 5:41 are to begin with we are simply 5:44 installing a few necessary components 5:46 such as curl wget and some app transport 5:49 https modules then as you can see on the 5:52 second line we are pulling down the mini 5:54 Cube release and then finally we are 5:57 installing mini Cube into our user your 5:59 local bin mini Cube folder so let's run 6:02 these 6:04 commands now that mini cube is installed 6:07 let's check the mini Cube 6:08 version and we're running version 6:12 1.331 also we need to install CP CTL if 6:16 you remember in micro Kates we had 6:18 access to cube CTL but it's the version 6:21 that is compatible with micro Kates that 6:23 is bundled with that solution so we need 6:26 to install Cube CTL to work with mini 6:28 Cube as well as other kubernetes 6:30 variants so let's paste in those 6:32 commands first off we are simply just 6:34 curling Cube C next we need to change 6:37 the mode of that Cube CTL executable and 6:41 then finally we want to move our Cube 6:44 CTL command into the user local bin 6:47 folder and now we should have access to 6:49 cube CTL and we do finally we need to 6:52 configure mini Cube to start and we're 6:55 telling it which driver we're going to 6:57 use in this case we're using Docker 6:59 which I have already pre-installed in 7:01 this environment so we just simply 7:03 issued the command mini Cube start-- 7:06 driver equals 7:10 Docker so now as you can see we have 7:12 mini Cube installed and one of the neat 7:14 things that it does for us automatically 7:16 is it sets a context to our mini Cube 7:19 cluster so we don't have to do that 7:21 manually and as we can see we've got 7:23 mini Cube ready as a control plane and 7:25 we're running version 7:27 130.0 now moving on in the list we have 7:30 k3s by Rancher Labs k3s is an optimized 7:34 lightweight kubernetes distribution that 7:36 can run on an arm architecture as well 7:39 as x86 and iot devices it's designed to 7:43 be easy to install and manage it's a 7:45 simple binary that you download and you 7:48 can be up and running with that 7:49 kubernetes cluster even though it's 7:51 meant for production networks it's also 7:53 a great distribution for home Labs since 7:56 it can run as a single or multiple nodes 7:59 and you can even set up things like ha 8:01 and shared storage with it and you can 8:04 also install it with a single script 8:06 from Rancher now why k3s well once again 8:10 it's a lightweight kubernetes 8:12 distribution and it's easy to set up 8:14 it's suitable for single or multiple 8:17 nodes and it's ideal for resource 8:19 constrained environments all of those 8:22 things are a great fit for most home lab 8:24 environments so let's take a look and 8:27 see how we can get up and running easily 8:29 with k3s installing k3s is as simple as 8:33 a oneline command it basically pulls 8:35 down the install script from k3s I and 8:40 runs the script so let's run that on 8:42 line 8:44 command as we can see with this simple 8:47 script our k3s cluster has been started 8:50 we can verify our k3s installation by 8:53 issuing the command k3s D- version and 8:56 we can see we've got k3s version 1.2 29 9:00 now to interact with our k3s cluster 9:02 with Cube CTL we need to do just a few 9:05 configuration steps first of all we need 9:07 to copy the Etsy Rancher k3s k3s yaml 9:12 file to our home directory and then 9:14 we're going to set a path statement to 9:17 reference this file for our k3s coup CTL 9:21 configuration now we have copied it so 9:23 what we want to do is issue the command 9:25 to add permissions for our current user 9:28 Linux admin then we want to export the 9:31 CP config pass statement to reference 9:34 the k3s file now we can take a look at 9:37 our cctl config by issuing the command 9:40 cctl config view finally we should be 9:43 able to interact with our k3s 9:47 cluster now you might not realize it but 9:49 Docker desktop includes a kubernetes 9:52 environment it's super easy to enable 9:55 right from the docker desktop settings 9:57 and it allows you to get up and running 9:59 with a single node kubernetes 10:01 environment that you can develop on you 10:04 can learn on and you can just simply 10:06 play around with and learn the workings 10:08 of kubernetes now why Docker desktop 10:10 kubernetes well it's easy to enable and 10:12 use and most likely most of us have 10:15 Docker desktop already installed and 10:17 configured it's great for development 10:19 and testing and it doesn't require 10:21 dedicated Hardware you simply run it on 10:24 a workstation that you already use as 10:26 your daily driver or a part-time home 10:28 lab service server so let's see how to 10:31 enable kubernetes in Dr desktop so after 10:34 opening Dr desktop you will navigate to 10:37 the docker desktop settings you will see 10:39 an option for kubernetes under your 10:41 settings menu after we click kubernetes 10:44 we have a simple checkbox that allows us 10:48 to enable kubernetes and if you note the 10:50 description it allows it to start a 10:52 kubernetes single node cluster when 10:54 starting Docker desktop that is 10:57 literally it all we have to do is check 10:59 the box and then click the apply and 11:03 restart button then we will see a 11:05 kubernetes cluster installation 11:07 confirmation dialogue box and we'll note 11:09 it will tell us that the installation 11:11 takes a few minutes and requires an 11:14 internet connection and that is so that 11:16 Docker desktop will be able to download 11:18 the kubernetes installation that it 11:20 needs so we're simply going to click the 11:23 install 11:25 button and as simple as that we've got 11:28 kubernetes and enabled and as we can see 11:30 here we've got kubernetes running now 11:33 let's see if we can connect to our 11:35 Docker desktop kubernetes 11:39 installation so we can see the name of 11:41 our node is Docker desktop it's a 11:43 control plane node and it's running 11:45 version 1.29.20 11:59 it's even built all around kubernetes 12:02 for running Rancher desktop and one of 12:04 the things that I really like about 12:05 rancher desktop is that it provides a 12:07 tremendous amount of flexibility in 12:10 which kubernetes version that you want 12:12 to spin up in ranch or desktop you can 12:14 literally select the version that you 12:17 want Rancher desktop to install as your 12:20 kubernetes cluster now that is a great 12:22 Advantage for those that are in 12:24 development or that must work with a 12:26 specific version of kubernetes perhaps 12:28 it's they're running in production and 12:30 they need to develop also locally on 12:33 that same version of kubernetes so ranch 12:35 or desktop makes that process super easy 12:38 so why Rancher desktop well it runs 12:40 kubernetes under the hood with k3s which 12:44 is a kubernetes distribution that we've 12:46 already discussed on the list it allows 12:48 you to choose the kubernetes version and 12:51 that's something that is not as easily 12:53 done in some of the other kubernetes 12:56 dros that we've mentioned on the list 12:58 and it's not available to do in Docker 13:01 desktop you simply have to accept the 13:04 version of kubernetes that Docker 13:06 desktop installs for you and it's ideal 13:09 for developers and home lab enthusiasts 13:11 like Docker desktop that we've already 13:13 mentioned you don't have to have 13:15 dedicated Hardware you just simply 13:16 install ranch or desktop on your daily 13:18 driver workstation or part-time home lab 13:21 server that you also use as your daily 13:24 driver and your up and running with 13:26 kubernetes so let's see how to configure 13:28 kuber kubernetes in Rancher desktop so 13:31 when you install Rancher desktop one of 13:33 the first things that you're prompted to 13:35 do is to set up kubernetes and as you 13:38 notice the default is enable kubernetes 13:41 and it will select the latest stable 13:43 release we can also go in and select the 13:46 latest release which is 13.2 at the time 13:50 of this video however we'll leave it at 13:52 the 1. 13:53 29.6 stable release it also allows you 13:56 to pick your container engine as a 13:59 default we can select container D or we 14:02 can use Docker D so I'm just going to 14:04 select the defaults on everything across 14:06 the board so we simply click okay and as 14:09 we can see after the initial setup and 14:11 selection of our kubernetes version we 14:14 can see that the kubernetes cluster is 14:17 showing at 1.29 6 as what we selected 14:21 and we can see it's registering the WSL 14:23 distribution which is using underneath 14:26 the hood and we can see that our rencher 14:29 desktop is indeed enabled with 14:31 kubernetes after the cluster is online 14:34 it has some really neat utilities that 14:36 we can use from within Rancher desktop 14:38 for example we have the cluster 14:40 dashboard and this is a really great 14:42 little utility that is built into 14:45 Rancher desktop that allows you to see 14:46 all of your kubernetes resources such as 14:48 name spaces nodes events workloads so on 14:51 and so forth so I can click the nodes 14:54 and we can see our single node 14:56 kubernetes cluster that is running on 14:59 this particular machine we can also go 15:01 to the command line and look at things 15:03 with cctl so cctl get notes and we're 15:07 going to see our Rancher desktop node 15:09 which is Win test the host that Rancher 15:11 desktop is running on and again we're 15:13 running 15:15 29.6 k3s great solution in Rancher 15:19 desktop that allows you to easily spin 15:22 up a kubernetes home lab with little 15:25 effort so there you have it the best 15:27 kubernetes dro for your home lab in 2024 15:31 and the best is subjective these are 15:34 kubernetes installations that I think 15:36 are super easy they're very effective in 15:39 learning and you can easily get up and 15:42 running without a lot of complicated 15:44 steps or processes whether you're just 15:46 starting out or looking to build a 15:47 complex setup there is a kubernetes 15:50 distribution for you make sure to check 15:52 out my full blog post on Tech to Cloud 15:55 for a detailed guide on setting up your 15:57 kubernetes home lab using the kubernetes 16:01 variants that we have discussed in 16:03 detail in this video if you found this
