"East of Eden" by Isa Glenn is a novel written in the early 20th century. Set amid contemporary literary New York, it revolves around the brilliant and enigmatic Eva Litchfield and her marriage into the established Van Suydam family. The main focus appears to be the clash between Eva's individuality and creative drive with the expectations and traditions of her husband's family, particularly as seen through the watchful eye of her formidable mother-in-law. Through the perspectives of friends, the novel seems primed to explore themes of artistic identity, social belonging, marriage, and the tensions inherent in New York's evolving society. The opening of the novel introduces Eva Litchfield as a beautiful, emotionally elusive writer of genius, whose marriage to Nicholas Van Suydam—himself part of a patrician New York family—is widely discussed among her circle of literary friends. Narrated by Dinah Avery, newly returned from France, the story unfolds through a patchwork of conversations and social encounters, each revealing different perspectives on Eva, her husband, and the imposing Mrs. Van Suydam. The reader is quickly immersed in an atmosphere of lively gossip, partisan judgments, and subtle rivalries within New York's literary elite. As Dinah seeks to piece together the truth behind Eva's troubled marriage, the narrative paints a vivid picture of the social dynamics, anxieties, and ambitions of its characters, setting the stage for an intimate exploration of personal and cultural conflicts.
