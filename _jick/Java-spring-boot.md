The '@Autowired' annotation is correct because it is specifically designed in Spring to automatically inject dependencies into your classes, streamlining the process of managing object lifecycles and dependencies. This aligns with the learning objective of understanding dependency injection in Spring, making your applications more modular and easier to manage.

Auto-Configuration is correct because it automatically configures your Spring Boot application based on the dependencies present in your project, simplifying the setup process and allowing you to focus on developing features rather than boilerplate configuration. This directly aligns with the learning objective of understanding how Spring Boot simplifies application setup and management.

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is ==a programming paradigm that enhances modularity by separating "cross-cutting concerns" from the main business logic==. These concerns, such as logging, security, and performance profiling, are applied in many places and are defined within "aspects" to avoid code duplication. This makes the codebase cleaner, more organized, and easier to maintain.
