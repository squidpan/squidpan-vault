# Hello

Dear Jenn and Jeff,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me and discuss the current effort to leverage the dashboard user interface (UI) as a self-service tool for Pulse Data users. By self-service, I understand it as being a site where users can onboard and configure access to needed functionality without IT assistance. Please let me know if I misunderstood anything.

Given that the the scope of the project is based on the current support to top tier clients, it must serve as a solid foundation from which to map out the equivalent UI workflow use cases. I agree that capturing the current service workflow from the subject matter experts (SMEs) is key and wonder whether the SMEs are internal Gresham resources and/or from the clients' side. 

I have experience putting together how-to guides that are task, troubleshooting and product-oriented based on discussions with SMEs at different points of my career. Additionally, as part of the cloud migration at the Fed, I have worked on the initial phase of defining and documenting Rest API endpoints using Swagger (openapi specification 3.0) to define market data pricing endpoints. The endpoints and payloads were designed and mapped from the Oracle table view fields that are currently distributed to consumers.

My background working working as an implementation engineer and business analyst would allow me to help the team in documenting the details of the current process, map them to dashboard actions, document(e.g. screenshots and instructions) and test. I look forward to hearing back from you and have the opportunity to learn more about the project. Please do not hesitate to reach out for any questions or comments.

Thank you.
Paul

p.s.
For Jeff, I am including a sample Plantuml file that I created. It is text based code that works well with Markdown files and can be tracked under GIT version control system. Whenever possible, I use Visual studio code (plantuml, swagger) and Obsidian to manage notes and documentation.
