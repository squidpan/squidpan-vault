# Hello

Dear David,

Thank you for giving me a macro view of Gresham's data delivery life cycle to client systems and highlighting the need to automate resource intensive steps (manual) using Pulse Data's dashboard user interface. I got the good news from Jenn early morning and I am excited about this opportunity.

Thank you for the job.

Paul
