# Summary

Pulse Data's client onboarding process starts with the client sending an email to account team requesting a new account/feed to added or removed (offboarding). 

- Request detail in the email body is often incomplete requiring admin to follow up with the clients
1. call the bank and ask can you allow us access to your sftp?.
2. Can you add us to your system?
3. what is the account code, manager code?
4. guess from memory

lacking required information triggering used to create an internal ticket, research incomplete information, manually enter the required fields and submit it.

- Information in the email is not complete enough to fill out the required fields in the create the ticket 
- the goal is to automate current manual onboarind practice by providing the client with a self service dashboad portal
