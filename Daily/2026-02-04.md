# WHTD

- Using an existing account at ny.gov, I filed for unemployment insurance (UI) in New York and certified weekly benefits for week of 2026-02-02 since I worked in NYC for the past 18 months. [Ny.gov Dol File a claim for Benefits ](https://dol.ny.gov/unemployment-insurance-contact)
- it should take 3 -6 weeks
- Unemployment benefit is taxable (opted for withholding 10% for federal tax and 2.5% for state tax )
