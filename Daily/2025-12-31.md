# WHTD
- we are seeing the lawyer to talk about the will and how to proceed going forward
- need to talk to chi about chiah about mom and dad forgetting about jinie thru unupdated clause making it look like she doesn't exist - sister to disburse payment to paul for the lifetime. this is slap in the face, a betrayal from what she heard what mom and dad told her. 
- Now that jinie is taking care of things for all of us and them, the clause that paying me depends on chi-ah's discretion until death makes no sense.
