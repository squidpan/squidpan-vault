[What I Write in my Morning Pages - How to and Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysb0hnQSpt4)

## ...more
✍️✍️ There are certain things I write most days in my pages:

- How I’m feeling at that moment- what’s the state of my body, tired etc
- Where I am and the time
- Anything happening around me - the dog, the bin men etc
- Any sounds - e.g the crows outside - then I might expand on that imagining the source of the sound, where it’s coming from etc
- This then might lead to free associating around the sound
- Anything on my mind from the day before - any residues of yesterday and whatever this brings up
- Associations that flash across my mind - other times and places, fragments of memories
- I might comment on whether I’ve found my flow yet and what is holding me back (maybe I’m hungry or the dog wants to go out, my phone nearby etc.
- Whatever thoughts go through my mind - uncensored, no judgement- this is a good release.
- If I get stuck I often repeat the last word I wrote a few times until it leads to another word and I get started again
- Sometimes I just go with the rhythm of the words and let them bounce along
- Again check the state of my body - is my arm sore
- What’s the state of my pen and the ink
- How do I feel about the day ahead
- What would my fantasy for the day be
- What memories and associations does this bring up
- Things I can see
- Things I can touch, smell
