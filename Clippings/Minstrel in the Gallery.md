My stereo and 5.1 remixes of Jethro Tull’s 1975 album Minstrel in the Gallery comprise the complete original album, the B-side Summerday Sands, and a very different earlier recording of one of Ian Anderson’s most beautiful compositions “Requiem”.

In addition there are bonus stereo remixes of a 3 track BBC session, alternate takes of One White Duck and Grace, and flat transfers of the original stereo and quadrophonic mixes. Also included are stereo and 5.1 mixes of the band’s live performance at Olympia, Paris in July 1975, mixed by my good friend Jakko Jakszyk.
