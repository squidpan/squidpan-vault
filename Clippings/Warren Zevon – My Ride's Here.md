\[Verse 1\]  
[I was staying at the Marriott](https://genius.com/32347217/Warren-zevon-my-rides-here/I-was-staying-at-the-marriott)  
With Jesus and John Wayne  
[I was waiting for a chariot](https://genius.com/11958144/Warren-zevon-my-rides-here/I-was-waiting-for-a-chariot)  
They were waiting for a train  
[And the sky was full of carrion](https://genius.com/26317451/Warren-zevon-my-rides-here/And-the-sky-was-full-of-carrion)  
["I'll take the mazuma"  
Said Jesus to Marion  
"That's the 3:10 to Yuma"](https://genius.com/5044587/Warren-zevon-my-rides-here/Ill-take-the-mazuma-said-jesus-to-marion-thats-the-3-10-to-yuma)  
  
\[Chorus\]  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
  
\[Verse 2\]  
The Houston sky was changeless  
We galloped through bluebonnets  
[I was wrestling with an angel](https://genius.com/26317480/Warren-zevon-my-rides-here/I-was-wrestling-with-an-angel)  
You were working on a sonnet  
You said, "I believe the seraphim  
[Will gather up my pinto](https://genius.com/33954820/Warren-zevon-my-rides-here/Will-gather-up-my-pinto)  
[And carry me away, Jim  
Across the San Jacinto](https://genius.com/8083279/Warren-zevon-my-rides-here/And-carry-me-away-jim-across-the-san-jacinto)  

\[Chorus\]  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
  
\[Verse 3\]  
[Shelley and Keats were out in the street  
And even Lord Byron was leaving for Greece](https://genius.com/11958182/Warren-zevon-my-rides-here/Shelley-and-keats-were-out-in-the-street-and-even-lord-byron-was-leaving-for-greece)  
While back at the Hilton, last but not least  
[Milton was holding his sides](https://genius.com/11958204/Warren-zevon-my-rides-here/Milton-was-holding-his-sides)  
Saying, "You bravos had better be ready to fight  
Or we'll never get out of East Texas tonight  
That the trail is long and the river is wide  
And my ride's here"  
  
\[Instrumental Break\]  
  
\[Verse 4\]  
I was staying at the Westin  
I was playing to a draw  
[When in walked Charlton Heston  
With the Tablets of the Law  
He said, "It's still the Greatest Story"](https://genius.com/7598391/Warren-zevon-my-rides-here/When-in-walked-charlton-heston-with-the-tablets-of-the-law-he-said-its-still-the-greatest-story)  
I said, "Man, I'd like to stay  
But I'm bound for glory  
I'm on my way"  

\[Chorus\]  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
My ride's here  
My ride's here

## About

Written by Zevon and Paul Muldoon soon after Zevon had learned about his terminal disease, this is Zevon’s public face to the issue. The album deals with different aspects of death, but this last song is very personal. In it Zevon paints several surreal situations on the subject of death and the hereafter, and it lists some of his biggest literary influences in Western letters.
