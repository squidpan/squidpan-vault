# Summary



Hi Jenn,

  

Can we discuss the scope and plan for the Pulsedata (PD) onboarding optimization project? I would like to better understand what your expectations are of me and how I can work with the team effectively and efficiently to achieve it.

Here is my understanding and what I have been up to:

At a high level, the focus is to help transition our top 10 customers to use PD Onboarding UI as a self service tool to manage requests for their custodian data needs (add, remove, etc.) and move away from the current manual process of 

1) Emailing custodian feed requests to PD support team 

2) PD support team manually parsing out key onboarding information (e.g. add/remove, account code, manager code) from the email body - often incomplete

3) PD support team logs in to PD system (or DOTS, AMP?) and creates/manages tickets

In December, I sat down with Om who gave me an overview of PD system and with Vee who showed me an example of an email request submitted by Sage Advisory (manager) for BST (custodian) and how ticket entries look in DOTS system. Also I now have access to DOTS UAT and think I can use it to get some hands-on with creating tickets and learn the current process.

I am looking for directions and guidance on how to proceed. Let me know if you want me to schedule something.

Thank you.
paul
