# Hello

Hello kids,

I wish both of you, Alex and Sophie, a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. It was good to see Sophie over the Thanksgiving weekend! Also, how are things going with you, Alex? I would very much like to see you again sometime in the new year and catch up on things - Can we both work on it?

Grandma passed away this morning in her room on Christmas eve. We are flying out to Vancouver tomorrow and so is Chi-ah. We spoke to Mom everyday for the past month and also yesterday. 

Grandpa is getting no further treatments after a massive stroke from a week ago. Doctor says he feels no pain and is comfortable. We are going to VGH first thing Friday morning on the 26th and hope that we get to see him before anything else happens.

I will you keep you guys posted.
