# Hello

Hey Matt,

I remember showing up on the 8th floor about 7 years ago when I first met you. Back then I was so excited to be there on the job. 
Techrefresh days are always near and dear to my heart and that's when I started to use NPQS as a metaphor for anything and everything bad ass. I looked at NPQS like a band putting out epic songs and started to draw parallels between tag releases and album releases and elevated my connection to NPQS to the sonic level 

It's four letter word name was a perfect
