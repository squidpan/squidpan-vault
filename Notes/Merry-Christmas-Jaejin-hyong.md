# Hello
Hi hyong,

Thank you hyong. Right back at you and your family - Merry Christmas! Yeah you are right. it's been a long time since our last beer together. 
How's your new job? I also rolled off the project at the Fed after 7 years on 12/1 and I got a new job within the same company (Gresham technologies) doing some BA (business analyst) work on a self service portal application. I will start once I am back from Vancouver in January.

We are leaving for V. tomorrow on Christmas day to see my parents. This time could be the last time. Jinie is doing well. Say hello to Stephanie hyong su. 

We hope to see you in the new year.

paul
